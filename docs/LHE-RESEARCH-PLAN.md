*   **HRM** supplies a _slow_ planner state and a _fast_ worker that conditions token generation on subgoals within a single forward pass (two-timescale recurrent core). [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **EBM** scores whole-sequence candidates (and optionally shapes logits) to enforce global constraints and prefer trajectories that _actually work_ (tests pass, UI preconditions hold). For language, we follow sequence‑level energy modeling as in EDLM. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21357?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sL2F9YCMXf&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **Envs/benchmarks**: target **OSWorld** for real desktop/web tasks (and latency via OSWorld‑Human), **SWE‑bench Verified** for coding, and **WebArena/GAIA** for general web/tool use. [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv+2arXiv+2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16042?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Core components (build)
=======================

*   **LLM backbone (decoder‑only Transformer)**  
    Code‑tuned causal LM (supports tool calling and structured action grammar). In the ZIP: `TinyCausalLM` (PyTorch) with causal self‑attention; swap in HF weights later.
*   **HRM module (hierarchical)**  
    `HRMCore`: GRU planner (updates every K steps) + Transformer worker that conditions on the planner state to produce control vectors that steer decoding/tool selection. Mirrors HRM’s slow/fast recurrent scheme. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **Sequence EBM**  
    `SequenceEBM`: bidirectional encoder that assigns low energy to successful sequences. Used two ways: (1) **reranking** k candidates per step/segment; (2) **logit shaping** (energy‑guided small corrections) before sampling—keeping AR decoding but injecting sequence‑level preferences. EDLM motivates sequence‑level energies for LM quality/speed. Energy‑guided decoding for hallucination control in vision‑language shows the same principle. [arXiv+1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21357?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sL2F9YCMXf&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Inference protocol (token/act loop)
===================================

1.  Perceive state (text/code + screen/DOM tokens).
2.  **Planner tick** (every K steps): update subgoal latent  $g_t$ .
3.  **Worker** produces control vector  $c_t$  (plan‑conditioned).
4.  LLM proposes k candidate tokens/actions; optionally apply **energy‑guided logit shaping**.
5.  **EBM reranks** full candidates (energy + length/test penalties), pick argmin‑energy.
6.  Execute action; update state; if subgoal achieved, advance planner.

(See `hybrid_agent/decoding/energy_guided_decoding.py` for rerank & shaping stubs.)

Training recipe (curriculum)
============================

**Stage A – Supervised pretrain**

*   Code + tool‑use corpora for LM; action‑grammar heads for UI ops.
*   HRM trained end‑to‑end: predict next tokens/actions while learning latent subgoals without explicit CoT supervision (aligned with HRM design). [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Stage B – Imitation on environments**

*   OSWorld & WebArena traces (multi‑app workflows, file I/O, browser). Train success‑weighted CE on trajectories. [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13854?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Stage C – EBM fitting**

*   Positives: sequences that _execute successfully_ (tests pass / task success); Negatives: failed or perturbed runs. Train EBM via NCE. For language, follow EDLM’s sequence‑energy training; for actions, add feature penalties (schema violations, unsafe clicks). [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21357?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Stage D – RL fine‑tune (hierarchical)**

*   HRM rewards: subgoal completions; LM head rewards: end success; EBM energy as a shaping term.

**Stage E – Code specialization**

*   SWE‑bench Verified SFT + RL from pass@1 under harness; unit‑test‑aware decoding with EBM (energy adds test‑fail cost). [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Action & constraint model (for EBM features)
============================================

*   Hard constraints: tool schemas, file path policies, compile/syntax checks, UI preconditions.
*   Soft constraints: latency cost (OSWorld‑Human shows latency matters), window focus changes, undo‑ability. Include these as additive energy terms. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16042?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Evaluation targets
==================

*   **OSWorld**: success rate @ 361–369 tasks; temporal efficiency (p95 end‑to‑end latency). [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16042?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **SWE‑bench Verified**: pass@1/3 on the Verified split, reproducible harness. [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/SWE-bench/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **WebArena/VisualWebArena** for visual DOM ops; **GAIA** for open web/tool questions. [arXiv+1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13854?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Practical sizes (starting point)
================================

*   LLM: 7–8B code‑tuned (swap into `TinyCausalLM` wrapper later).
*   HRM: 0.5–1B (fast worker dominates).
*   EBM: 0.3–0.7B bidirectional encoder.
*   Decoding: beam/nbest 4–8, EBM‑weighted rerank each segment; energy‑guided shaping α∈\[0.2,1.0\].

What you can run now
====================

*   The ZIP includes:
    *   `models/` (LLM, HRM, EBM), `decoding/` (EBM rerank & shaping), `tools/`, `envs/` adapters, and training/eval stubs.
    *   A demo that compiles and runs on CPU: `hybrid_agent/run_agent.py` selects next tokens via EBM‑reranked candidates.
*   Download and inspect: **hybrid\_hrm\_ebm\_agent.zip**.

If you want me to wire this to specific weights (code LLM), OSWorld/WebArena runners, and SWE‑bench harness with pass/fail‑driven energies, say the word and I’ll deliver the fully integrated training/eval scripts next.

Promising—cheap capability composition. AoE linearly interpolates MoE parents tensor‑wise to spawn functional “child” LLMs; authors show a 671B DeepSeek V3+R1 Chimera with ~R1‑level reasoning and ~40% fewer tokens; traits sometimes flip sharply with mix ratios. I’d use it to rapidly spawn task‑specialized backbones and gate/distill with HRM+EBM. Caveats: architecture/tokenizer compatibility, rigorous evals, alignment drift.

Hybrid LLM-HRM-EBM Agent for Real-Time Autonomous Coding and OS Control

Autonomous Coding & Computer-Operating Agent Architecture
=========================================================

Motivation and Inspiration
--------------------------

Building an **autonomous coding and computer-operating agent** represents a bold step toward AI systems that can perform complex software tasks end-to-end with minimal human intervention. The motivation stems from the promise of automating tedious or complex workflows – from writing code to operating software – which could dramatically accelerate development cycles and reduce human error. Such an agent could **assist developers** by handling routine coding tasks, **empower non-programmers** to accomplish computing tasks through natural language, and run continuously to maintain or update systems in real-time. In essence, it aims to be a _digital co-worker_ that can do everything a human engineer might do on a computer, guided by high-level instructions[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=Today%E2%80%99s%20article%20features%20a%20new,their%20vision%20is%20rather%20unique)[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=Adept%20has%20now%20announced%20its,computer%20interface%20%28HCI).

Recent breakthroughs in **large language models (LLMs)** and AI agents have inspired this vision. Models like OpenAI's _Codex_ and DeepMind's _AlphaCode_ demonstrated that LLMs can generate working code for complex problems, even achieving **competitive programming performance** by generating many candidate programs and filtering them through tests[sh-tsang.medium.com](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/brief-review-competition-level-code-generation-with-alphacode-6d72bf4f77f4#:~:text=%2A%20Recent%20Transformer%20,system%20has%20performed%20competitively%20in). Meanwhile, _agent architectures_ such as AutoGPT and Adept’s ACT-1 hint at how an AI can use tools and perform multi-step actions in digital environments. For example, Adept’s ACT-1 is a large transformer-based model trained to use software like a human (clicking, typing, browsing) when given natural language commands[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=Adept%20has%20now%20announced%20its,computer%20interface%20%28HCI)[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=Adept%20has%20released%20a%20few,in%20user%20feedback%20to%20improve). These advances show that **code generation** and **digital action** are both within reach of AI; the next challenge is combining them into a cohesive system that operates autonomously and reliably.

The inspiration also comes from multi-agent systems like _ChatDev_, which model a virtual software company with AI agents in different roles (planner, coder, tester, etc.) collaborating via natural language[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=company%20that%20mirrors%20the%20established,its%20remarkable%20efficacy%20in%20software)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=software%20tech%20nology%20company%20%E2%80%93,creative%20ideas%20are%20generated%2C%20prototype). ChatDev’s success in rapidly producing software with multiple agents validating each other’s work suggests that modular role specialization and dialogue can greatly reduce errors (like code hallucinations)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=thinking%20that%20is%20absent%20in,review%20and%20suggestion%20feedbacks)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=atomic%20subtasks,the%20achievement%20of%20desired%20outputs). This informs our design to incorporate **modularity and feedback** mechanisms. In summary, our agent draws on the strengths of LLM-driven code generation, tool-use planning from autonomous agents, and collaborative verification from multi-agent paradigms. The goal is an agent that not only writes and executes code, but also _orchestrates its actions in a real computer environment_, all while learning and improving over time.

Key Challenges and Design Considerations
----------------------------------------

Designing an autonomous coding agent that operates a computer in real-time presents several **challenges** that shape the architecture. We first **critically analyze** the requirements and limitations of such a system, to motivate improvements and research directions:

*   **Long-Horizon Reasoning:** Unlike single-turn Q&A, coding projects or operating system tasks are multi-step processes. A naïve end-to-end LLM often falters on lengthy, complex tasks due to limited short-term memory and tendency to lose coherence or make logical mistakes over many steps[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=Directly%20generating%20an%20entire%20software,making%20poses%20significant). The architecture must facilitate breaking down high-level goals into sub-tasks and maintaining continuity – this calls for an explicit _planning module_ and robust memory.
*   **Memory and Context:** The agent needs to remember instructions, past actions, code it wrote, results of execution, and possibly long-running context. Standard transformer models have a fixed context window, so important information can get lost. A **persistent memory** solution is required to store and retrieve relevant facts beyond the context window[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=AI%20agent%20memory%20architecture%20includes,two%20types%20of%20memory)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Vector%20databases%20and%20retrieval). Both short-term working memory and long-term memory (e.g. using a vector database for embeddings) should be integrated, so the agent can recall prior interactions or learned knowledge even across sessions[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=%2A%20Working%20memory%20is%20session,last%20conversation%20with%20a%20lead)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=To%20implement%20persistent%20memory%2C%20agents,remember%20even%20loosely%20related%20contexts).
*   **Reliability and Validation:** Generating code or executing actions can have serious consequences if incorrect. Pure LLM outputs may contain errors or “hallucinations.” Therefore, the architecture must include _verification and feedback loops_. This might involve executing generated code in a sandbox and checking outputs, running test cases, or employing a secondary model to review and critique code. The ChatDev example shows the value of **cross-examination** – e.g. a “reviewer” agent finding vulnerabilities introduced by a “coder” agent[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=user%20requirements,main%20contributions%20are%20as%20follows)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=atomic%20subtasks,the%20achievement%20of%20desired%20outputs). Even if we use a single model, we can emulate this by iterative self-critique (the model re-reading its own output) or by having distinct phases for generation and review.
*   **Tool Use and Environment Interaction:** The agent must operate a computer, which involves using **external tools** and interfaces – from compilers and interpreters for running code, to file systems, editors, or even GUIs for clicking buttons. This requires the architecture to incorporate a _Tool Interface Module_ that the agent can call. Prior research suggests augmenting LLMs with tool use is critical for tasks requiring up-to-date information or computations the model can't do by itself[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=Huge%20language%20models%20,X%2C%20AI21%20Labs%E2%80%99%20MRKL)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=When%20you%20look%20for%20the,More%20specifically). The design should treat tools as first-class actions the agent can plan for. This includes safeguarding these operations (e.g. to prevent harmful commands) and handling errors (if a tool returns an error, the agent should recognize it and adjust).
*   **Real-time Operation:** The agent is intended to work **online and in real time**, possibly continuously. This means it should handle asynchronous events or updates (for example, responding to new user instructions on the fly, or adapting to changes like a file update or an error that occurs during execution). The architecture should be capable of event-driven triggers rather than only sequential prompt-response. It also means performance and latency matter – a highly efficient inference pipeline is needed so the agent can respond within reasonable timeframes while running on the available hardware (4× NVIDIA A100 GPUs). Achieving real-time feedback while using large models is non-trivial and may require optimizations like batching, model compression, or using smaller specialized models for certain quick reactions.
*   **Scalability and Training Constraints:** With only _4 A100 40GB GPUs_ available, there is a limit to model size and training speed. Training a very large model from scratch on this hardware would take an extremely long time (for instance, one study found even a 6.9B parameter model could take on the order of months to train on 4 A100s)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.23261v1#:~:text=8%201%202%204%208,7%2027%2014%207%204). Therefore, we need to leverage pre-trained models and efficient fine-tuning. The architecture should be **modular** not only in operation, but in development: components can be trained or improved independently (for example, the code generation module can be fine-tuned on coding tasks while the tool-use planner can be developed with separate simulations). We also must plan for _progressive scaling_: an initial prototype might use a smaller model and fewer training steps (a few weeks of fine-tuning), and later phases can incorporate larger models or longer training (many weeks to months) for “leading performance.” The design should remain viable as we scale up, without fundamental changes – hence an emphasis on generality and modular interfaces.
*   **Safety and Alignment:** An autonomous agent with access to a computer and coding abilities could accidentally or intentionally perform destructive actions (deleting files, misusing network access, etc.). Ensuring alignment with user intentions and ethical constraints is crucial. The architecture should allow incorporating safety checks or an oversight mechanism. Possible approaches include a **policy model** that filters or vetoes high-risk actions, or human-in-the-loop approval for certain operations during development. While this may not be the central focus of architecture, it influences design decisions (for example, restricting the agent’s operating sandbox and gradually increasing privileges as it proves reliable).

By confronting these challenges up front, we identify the need for certain architectural elements: a planning and decision module, memory management, a validation feedback loop, a robust tool interface, and a modular training approach. In the next section, we present a model architecture designed with these needs in mind, and we highlight improvements over a naïve single-LLM approach. This serves as the foundation for our development and training plan.

Architectural Overview
----------------------

To meet the above challenges, we propose a **modular architecture** for the autonomous coding & computer-operating agent. At a high level, the system follows a **sense-plan-act** loop (as in classic agent design[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Classic%20agent%20loop)), but with modern enhancements for memory and tool-use[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Modern%20loop%20in%20AI%20agents). The architecture can be visualized as a set of interacting components:

[developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-your-first-llm-agent-application/#:~:text=When%20building%20a%20large%20language,see%20Introduction%20to%20LLM%20Agents)**Figure:** _High-level agent architecture with core modules: an LLM-based reasoning core, a planning module, tool interfaces (for code execution & OS actions), and memory storage. The agent processes input (goal or trigger), devises a plan, uses tools/actions to execute steps, consults memory for context, and produces results. It then observes new inputs (e.g. execution outputs) and repeats the cycle._

At the heart is the **Agent Core**, essentially a large language model (or a collection of LLM-based behaviors) that drives reasoning and generation. Surrounding it are modules that provide structure and interface to the outside world. The major components are:

*   **1\. Agent Core (LLM Brain):** This is a transformer-based model (or ensemble of models) that serves as the central _reasoner and coder_. It interprets instructions, generates code or text, and responds to queries. It is pre-trained on large text and code corpora (for a strong base of knowledge) and then fine-tuned on instructions and programming tasks. The Agent Core is promptable to produce step-by-step plans or to explain its reasoning (using chain-of-thought prompting when needed). It can assume different _personas_ or modes: e.g., a “coder” mode that writes code given a specification, or a “system operator” mode that issues commands. Conceptually, this core is analogous to the “agent’s brain” that decides the next action. By design, it works in tandem with the planning module and tool interfaces rather than doing everything implicitly. We expect to start with a moderately large model (say 6B-13B parameters) that fits on a single A100 GPU for inference, and possibly scale up to ~30B if needed (sharded across GPUs) as training progresses. The core model will likely utilize **instruction-tuned** weights (similar to GPT-4 or CodeLlama) so it can follow natural language commands and generate well-structured code.
*   **2\. Planning and Decision Module:** This component is responsible for breaking down high-level tasks into actionable steps and deciding on the sequence of those steps. In some implementations, this is an explicit separate module; in others, it might be an emergent capability of the Agent Core guided by prompts. We choose a hybrid approach: a lightweight planning module guides the LLM with a structured approach to multi-step problems. For example, upon receiving a new goal or problem, the agent might first call a `TaskPlanner` function (which could itself use the LLM or simple rules) to produce a plan: “Step 1: Do X; Step 2: Do Y; …”. This plan can then be executed stepwise. The planning module can also monitor progress and re-plan if something unexpected happens (akin to a _monitoring loop_). By explicitly representing the plan, the agent gains the ability to adjust mid-course, skip or add steps if needed, which is crucial for flexibility[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Planning%20%26%20decision)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=%2A%20Rule,thought%20reasoning). Planning strategies may include known AI paradigms: e.g., a **ReAct framework** (Reason+Act) where the LLM first reasons (perhaps producing thoughts in scratchpad) before each action[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=,Coordination%20and%20delegation%20are%20key), or leveraging a _tree search_ for complex problem decomposition. The module ensures that the agent doesn't act blindly or greedily; it bridges the gap between _intent and action_ by asking “What should I do next and in what order?”[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Planning%20connects%20intent%20to%20action,flow)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Agents%20that%20use%20dynamic%20planning,execution%20until%20conditions%20are%20met).
*   **3\. Tool Interface & Execution Module:** The agent will have a suite of **tools** at its disposal – essentially APIs or functions to interact with the environment. Key tools include:
    *   _Code Execution:_ The ability to write code to a file and run it (for example, running a Python script or a compiled program) and then capture the output or errors. This allows the agent to test the code it writes and use runtime feedback for debugging. It may use a sandboxed interpreter or container for safety.
    *   _Operating System Actions:_ This includes actions like reading/writing files, browsing the web (if allowed), or controlling GUI applications. We can implement a virtual operating environment (for training) where the agent’s actions (like keyboard or mouse events, or shell commands) are captured. For instance, the agent might have an API `open_application(name)` or `click_button(window, label)` to interact with GUI, or `shell(command)` for command-line.
    *   _External Knowledge Tools:_ For coding help, the agent might access documentation or do a web search when stuck. A search tool can retrieve relevant information (e.g., from online manuals or StackOverflow), which the Agent Core can then incorporate[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Deep%20integration%20with%20business%20tools)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=,and%20complete%20the%20flow%20autonomously).
    *   _Communication Tools:_ In a multi-agent or collaborative scenario, the agent could spawn sub-agents or communicate with a human (e.g., ask for clarification). In our design, this is an optional extension – for now, we focus on a single agent, but the architecture could support multi-agent communication channels as additional tools.
    The Tool Interface module acts as an **adapter** between the high-level agent and these low-level operations. The agent core issues an _action command_ (often as text, like “SEARCH(query)” or “RUN code.py”), and the interface carries it out then returns the result back into the agent’s input. This design is informed by the **MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language)** paradigm, which suggests using discrete modules for non-linguistic tasks and having the language model coordinate among them[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=addition%20to%20linguistic%20processing%2C%20we,system%2C%20some%20of). By delegating computation or actions to tools, we avoid forcing the LLM to do everything. For example, the LLM can call a calculator tool for arithmetic or execute code rather than guessing an output. _Critically, this modular tool use helps bypass LLM limitations_ in knowledge and reasoning[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=When%20you%20look%20for%20the,More%20specifically)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=Lack%20of%20reasoning,the%20tip%20of%20an%20iceberg). Our architecture will have a defined schema for tool use (for example, a syntax the LLM uses like `[TOOL: <name> | <parameters>]` in its output, which the system intercepts and executes). This approach has been validated by prior agent frameworks that combine LLMs with external tools to achieve far more robust performance on complex tasks[developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-your-first-llm-agent-application/#:~:text=When%20building%20a%20large%20language,see%20Introduction%20to%20LLM%20Agents)[developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-your-first-llm-agent-application/#:~:text=,go%20beyond%20simple%20agents%2C%20which).
*   **4\. Memory Module:** To support long-term coherence and learning, the agent includes a Memory subsystem. We incorporate **two levels of memory**[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=AI%20agent%20memory%20architecture%20includes,two%20types%20of%20memory):
    *   _Short-term Working Memory:_ This is essentially the conversation or task state that’s immediately relevant. In implementation, this could be the recent dialogue or the current code and error messages the agent is working with. This is kept within the LLM’s context window as much as possible.
    *   _Long-term Persistent Memory:_ This is a store of information that persists across sessions or across different tasks. It can include knowledge the agent has gained (e.g., “I tried approach X before and it failed”) or user-specific context (if the agent is personalized). We will use a **vector database** (embedding store) to save such information as dense vectors[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Vector%20databases%20and%20retrieval). The agent core can query this memory by embedding the current situation and finding similar past contexts. For example, if the agent solved a similar coding bug a week ago, it can retrieve that solution. Persistent memory also helps reduce forgetting – even if the exact detail is out of the context window, the agent can recall it when needed by a similarity search.
    The memory module is critical for an agent that learns over time. During training phases, we will populate an initial knowledge base (for instance, important OS commands, common code fixes). In deployment, the agent will continue appending to memory new insights (with some pruning or summarization strategy to keep it manageable). This design draws on cognitive architectures and recent agent research that emphasize memory as a key to **lifelong learning**[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291#:~:text=,acquires%20diverse%20skills%2C%20and)[theahura.substack.com](https://theahura.substack.com/p/llms-are-programming-languages-a#:~:text=2%29%20theahura,Let%27s%20go%20through). It also enables the agent to operate _online_: as new data arrives or the environment changes, the agent logs these events to memory and can adapt behavior accordingly rather than relying solely on static pretrained knowledge.
*   **5\. Self-Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** We include this as a logical component (it may not be a single module but a pattern in the agent’s operation). After each action or output, the agent should verify whether the result is as expected. For coding tasks, this means running tests or sanity-checking the output. For operating tasks, it means checking the state of the system (did the file actually copy? did the email actually send?). If a discrepancy or error is found, the agent uses that feedback to adjust: either correct its code, try a different approach, or in some cases backtrack on the plan. This _learn-from-feedback_ ability can be implemented via reinforcement learning (reward the agent for successful outcomes) or via explicit reasoning steps (the agent core generating a reflection like “The code crashed with error X, I will fix that before proceeding”). We plan to harness the LLM’s capability for reasoning by prompt – e.g., after an error, feed the error message back in and ask the model (as an expert debugger) what went wrong and how to fix it. This is analogous to what human programmers do: run, see error, debug, and repeat. Over time, the agent should internalize common errors and need fewer iterations (this can be helped by training, see later sections).

All these components interact in an **agent loop**. In a typical loop iteration:

1.  The agent receives a **trigger** (could be a new user request like "Develop a script that renames all files to lowercase" or an internal trigger like completion of a previous step).
2.  It updates its **memory** with the latest context (e.g., note the user request, recall related past tasks).
3.  The **planning module** (with the help of the Agent Core if needed) formulates a plan: break the request into steps (design solution, write code, test code, deploy).
4.  The Agent Core then goes through the steps. For each step, it may invoke a **tool** via the Tool Interface:
    *   If writing code, it uses an internal editor interface to produce code.
    *   If running code or a command, it calls the execution environment.
    *   If information is needed, it uses a search/documentation tool.  
        The output of each tool (execution results, search results, etc.) is fed back to the Agent Core.
5.  The **memory module** may store intermediate results or important decisions at each step (for example, “used algorithm X to solve the problem” or the output logs from tests).
6.  The agent evaluates the outcome: if the goal is achieved (tests passed, or user confirmed success), it ends the loop and outputs the final result (e.g., the final code or a confirmation that the task is done). If not, it _replans or iterates_ – possibly revising the plan or fixing errors, then trying again. This is where the self-monitoring feedback is crucial.
7.  Throughout, a safety layer monitors actions. Potentially unsafe or irreversible operations (like deleting files or making network requests) could be flagged for confirmation or handled by a restricted execution mode.

This architecture is **modular by design**, meaning each component could be improved or replaced without overhauling the whole system. For instance, one could swap in a more advanced planning algorithm, or incorporate a specialized code analysis module, as new research yields improvements. The modular approach aligns with the notion of _neuro-symbolic systems_: we combine powerful neural language models with symbolic or tool-based components for knowledge and reasoning[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2205.00445#:~:text=of%20modern%20AI%2C%20LMs%20are,AI21%20Labs%E2%80%99%20MRKL%20system%20implementation). This helps overcome the limitations of an end-to-end model and makes the system more interpretable (we can inspect the plan, the tool invocations, etc., to debug the agent’s behavior).

Lastly, while the architecture is modular, we considered whether a more end-to-end approach (monolithic model) could suffice. For example, one could train a giant transformer to directly map from problem statements to solved code or to a sequence of OS actions. However, given the complexity, that would require infeasible amounts of data and would likely still struggle with reliability. By providing structure (planning, tools, memory), we guide the model and reduce the search space it has to learn. This should make training more sample-efficient and results more trustworthy. In summary, **our architecture emphasizes structure, memory, and action-interface integration, which are critical improvements** over a baseline architecture that lacks these distinct modules.

Technical Architecture Details
------------------------------

We now delve deeper into each major subsystem, providing technical details and design justifications:

### Agent Core (LLM) Details

The Agent Core is implemented as a **transformer-based language model** fine-tuned for instruction following and coding. A suitable starting point might be an open-source model like _CodeLlama_ (with 7B or 13B parameters) or _GPT-3.5/GPT-4 style_ architectures, which we will adapt. The choice depends on balancing capability with the 40GB memory per GPU limit – a 13B model can fit in 16-bit precision on one A100 (requiring ~26GB), leaving room for batch and context. If needed, we can split a larger model across multiple GPUs, but that introduces communication overhead; initially, we aim to keep the core model one per GPU for simplicity and speed. We will use **mixed-precision training** (BF16 or FP16) and possibly gradient checkpointing to maximize memory usage efficiency.

The model will be fine-tuned on a combination of:

*   **Code corpora** (to ensure strong coding ability). We will use datasets of code (like GitHub code, competitive programming problems, etc., similar to what AlphaCode and Codex used)[sh-tsang.medium.com](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/brief-review-competition-level-code-generation-with-alphacode-6d72bf4f77f4#:~:text=,released%20under%20the%20name%20CodeContests), filtered for quality. The model should learn various programming languages and common libraries.
*   **Instruction data** (to ensure it can follow natural language). We will include question-answer style data and higher-level instructions like “Create a program that does X” with known solutions, so it learns to respond helpfully.
*   **Agent-specific data:** This includes examples of using the planning format, tool API format, etc. For instance, we will few-shot teach the model the syntax to call tools (like how to format a `SEARCH()` command in the output). We may construct synthetic training prompts where the correct answer involves a sequence of reasoning and a tool call.

Architecturally, the model might be a standard decoder-only transformer (like GPT-style) which is typical for generative tasks. An alternative is an encoder-decoder (like T5 or a BART-based model) for better understanding of input instructions. However, because the agent will be interacting in a conversational or iterative fashion, a decoder LM that continues from context is very natural. We will likely implement the agent core as an **autoregressive model with a long context window** (many recent models support 4K to 16K tokens context; longer is better to handle big code files and accumulated dialogue).

One key design decision: we might maintain multiple _system prompt templates_ to steer the core's behavior. For example, a system prompt for coding might inculcate: “You are an expert software developer. You write clear, correct code and explain your reasoning.” Another for system operations might say: “You have the ability to execute commands on a virtual computer. Plan carefully before each action.” These help condition the model to the right mindset and can be switched depending on task phase.

Finally, to enhance reliability, we could incorporate a **critic or verifier sub-model** alongside the main LLM. This could be a smaller model trained to evaluate code correctness or to detect risky instructions. For instance, after the LLM generates code, we run a static analysis tool or a linting model to catch issues before execution. This kind of _two-model system_ (one generates, one checks) is another layer of modular safety.

### Planning Module Implementation

For planning, we will implement a simple but effective system initially:

*   A function `plan_steps(task_description, context)` that returns a list of steps. This could be implemented via a prompt to the LLM itself (asking it to enumerate steps), since the LLM is quite capable at procedural breakdown if prompted correctly. For more determinism, we might use a few-shot prompt with examples of plans.
*   The plan is represented in a structured way, e.g., a list of step objects: `[{action: "write_code", detail: "Implement function X to do Y"}, {action: "test_code", detail: "Run unit tests"} ...]`. The exact schema will evolve, but clarity is key.
*   The agent then iterates through this list. One improvement is a dynamic planner that doesn't fix the plan upfront but rather generates the next action on the fly (this is similar to the ReAct strategy[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=,Coordination%20and%20delegation%20are%20key), where the model intermixes reasoning and acting). We may start with on-the-fly planning for flexibility: essentially the agent core will produce an output that either is an action or an intermediate thought. A special token or format distinguishes them. Many agent frameworks (like LangChain’s agents) use this approach: e.g., the model outputs: “Thought: I need to search for X. Action: SEARCH\['X'\]”. We will adopt a similar convention.
*   In case the environment throws a surprise (say an action fails or new info is received), the planning module can insert a new step or modify the plan. We can implement a simple feedback loop where after each action, the agent core is called with an updated prompt containing the observation (result of action) and asked “What now?”. This effectively re-plans incrementally. This way, the plan is continuously refined – a form of **dynamic planning** that has proven effective for agents handling unpredictable environments[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Planning%20connects%20intent%20to%20action,flow)[lindy.ai](https://www.lindy.ai/blog/ai-agent-architecture#:~:text=Agents%20that%20use%20dynamic%20planning,execution%20until%20conditions%20are%20met).

The planning module itself might not require separate ML components aside from leveraging the LLM. But as we progress, we might train a smaller policy network to predict the next best action given state (especially if using reinforcement learning, a policy network might learn to output tool choices directly). Initially, however, the simplicity of LLM-driven planning is sufficient.

### Tool Interface Module Details

Implementing the tool interface requires carefully defining the APIs and sandboxing the effects. We will create an **abstraction layer** in software for the agent’s actions. Concretely:

*   For code execution, we can spin up a Docker container or a restricted subprocess in which the agent’s code runs. The container can have resource limits and no internet (unless allowed) to prevent undesired side-effects. The Tool interface will take a code string and execute it, capturing stdout, stderr, and exit status, returning these to the agent.
*   For file operations, rather than letting the agent directly touch the real filesystem, we give it a virtual filesystem (could just be a specific directory it can work in). The interface exposes functions like `read_file(path)` and `write_file(path, content)`. The agent can thus request file reads/writes and the interface will perform them and return the result (file content or success message).
*   For web browsing or API calls, we will use stubbed tools during training (maybe a curated documentation set or a search corpus). During deployment, if allowed, the agent could call real APIs. But given the complexity, in initial phases we might limit this capability or simulate it.
*   GUI operations are harder to simulate. One option is to simplify and treat “computer operation” as mostly command-line or file operations. However, a true agent might need to handle GUIs. Projects like Microsoft’s “TaskMatrix” or OpenAI’s VPT (Minecraft agent) have trained agents to interpret pixels and send mouse/keyboard input[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=GPT,to%20some%20extent%2C%20their%20behavior). Incorporating a vision model to interpret screen output is an advanced step and probably beyond the first development phases. Still, our architecture is modular enough to plug that in later (it would become another sub-module: a _vision interpreter_ that converts screen to text description for the LLM, and an _action mapper_ that turns high-level actions to mouse moves). In early stages, we will focus on console-based operations and perhaps text-based UIs.

The design of the tool API will follow the principle of **least surprise** for the LLM – meaning we want the format to be easy for the model to learn. We’ll likely adopt a JSON or bracketed command format in the model outputs. For example, if the model outputs: `[{"tool": "execute_code", "code": "<base64-encoded or raw code here>"}]`, our system will intercept this (before the model’s output is shown to user), run the code, and then feed the result back in with a special format like: `[Result: "<captured stdout/err>"]`. This kind of cycle continues. Many tool-using agents implemented this request/response pattern, and we will train the model on it so it learns that, say, after seeing an error in the result, it should try another approach.

One crucial part of the tool interface is **error handling**. Tools can fail (code can crash, a file might not exist, etc.). The interface should catch exceptions and format them into a readable result for the LLM (for example, if a Python exception occurs, capture the traceback). The LLM then has context to debug. We will also ensure the agent cannot bypass the interface (since direct system calls could be dangerous); it only sees what we feed it. This not only sandboxes the agent but also simplifies its learning problem (it doesn't have to learn OS system call specifics, just the abstracted API we provide).

### Memory Module Implementation

The memory system will likely be implemented using an **embedding model + database**. We might use an off-the-shelf sentence transformer or OpenAI’s text-embedding model to transform chunks of text (e.g., a summary of a past interaction or a piece of code) into a vector. These vectors are stored with an associated key (maybe a timestamp or context tag). When retrieving, we embed the query (current context or a specific recall query) and do a nearest-neighbor search in the vector space to find relevant items.

For efficiency, this could run on CPU or a separate GPU (one of the four GPUs could be designated to handle embedding computations and database search, to offload from the main LLM GPU). Vector search libraries like FAISS or ElasticSearch with vector support can handle the scale (we expect memory size to be maybe on the order of thousands of entries, which is trivial for those tools).

In addition to vector recall, we will implement some **summarization** capability: if the memory grows too large (lots of past events), the agent or a background process can summarize older items to compress information. For instance, if the agent solved 10 different Python bug fixes, we might consolidate the lessons from them into one note like “Common bug patterns and fixes discovered.” This distilled knowledge remains in memory while raw logs might be pruned. This prevents the memory store from bloating over months of online operation.

The agent core will be given relevant memory entries at the right time. A strategy: whenever a new task comes in, retrieve any memory items with high similarity to the task description (this gives the agent potential hints, e.g., “We’ve done something similar before”). Also, after each major step or at end of task, store a record of what happened. We might store both successful outcomes and failures (failures are useful for the agent to not repeat mistakes – akin to the _“difficult question notes”_ concept where the agent learns from errors[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.16334#:~:text=intricate%20tasks,effective%20reasoning%20frameworks%20for%20human)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.16334#:~:text=with%20problems%20still%20faces%20many,systematic%20challenges)).

### Learning and Self-Improvement

Apart from the initial training, the architecture is set up to allow **continuous improvement**:

*   We log all the agent's interactions (with user and with tools). These can form a growing dataset of experiences. With user permission, we can periodically fine-tune the model on its own successful cases to reinforce good behavior, and on corrected mistakes to mitigate errors. This _online fine-tuning_ would likely be done offline in batches (e.g., overnight the agent retrains on data from the day).
*   Additionally, important lessons can be encoded in memory (which is a form of learning outside of weight updates). For example, if the agent discovers a new API or a tricky solution, storing it in memory means it’s immediately available next time – no gradient descent needed. This balances long-term learning (via weight updates) with short-term learning (via memory).
*   Since we have a limited compute budget, most heavy training will happen in planned phases (see next section), but the design allows small, frequent updates if needed (since fine-tuning on 4 GPUs for a short period, say an hour, could incorporate quite a bit of new data).

### Modularity and Integration

We chose a **modular architecture** not only for performance but for clarity and development speed. Each module (planning, memory, tools, core) can be developed and tested in isolation with mock components. For example, we can unit-test the planning module with predetermined tasks to see if it produces reasonable steps. We can simulate tool calls with known outputs to test if the Agent Core handles them properly. This modular testing is a big advantage over a monolithic end-to-end system.

However, modularity comes with the challenge of integration: ensuring the interfaces (format of data passing between modules) are well-designed and that the timing of operations (especially in an asynchronous real-time setting) is handled. We will likely orchestrate modules with an **event loop** or an agent manager process that sequentially or concurrently calls components as needed. For instance, it might work like: receive input -> call planner -> for each step: send to LLM -> if LLM outputs a tool action, execute tool -> send result back to LLM -> continue. This requires careful state management so that each iteration the LLM context is properly maintained (including the conversation, recent results, etc.). Using a high-level agent framework or creating a custom controller will be part of the implementation.

We anticipate iterative refinement: initial integration might be synchronous and linear (one step after another). Over time, if we need more reactivity, we could make the architecture event-driven (for example, using callbacks if an external event occurs, the agent can interrupt and re-plan). With 4 GPUs, we could even consider running multiple instances of the core or other modules in parallel (e.g., a separate process for a "tester" agent parallel to a "coder" agent, if we mimic multi-agent). But these are optimizations for later – the first pass will likely run on a single process that utilizes one GPU at a time for the core model inference. The other GPUs can be used for parallel training jobs, or hosting multiple smaller models (like the embedding model, or a possible separate code analysis model).

In terms of **performance**, each step involving the LLM will incur some latency (likely a few hundred milliseconds to a couple seconds, depending on model size and prompt length). On 4 A100s, if we use them all for inference in parallel with model parallelism, we could speed up a single large model's inference. But an easier way is to keep the model size moderate so one GPU suffices, and perhaps run multiple steps concurrently on different GPUs if the task allows (though most tasks are sequential). Real-time operation might be less about parallelizing inference and more about ensuring the agent doesn’t get stuck or take excessive iterations. Proper planning and tool use actually help here, as they make each step purposeful.

Phased Development and Training Plan
------------------------------------

Developing this agent will be an **iterative, multi-phase process**. We outline a first-pass phased plan, where each phase builds capabilities and addresses increasing complexity. This approach ensures we can learn from early prototypes and progressively scale up (especially important given limited hardware). Each phase includes development tasks and training regimes:

1.  **Phase 1: Prototype Core Coding Agent (Weeks 0-4)** – _Goal:_ Get a basic coding agent working in a constrained environment. In this phase, we focus on the code-generation ability in an offline setting. We start by fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a **coding dataset** (e.g., CodeContests from AlphaCode[sh-tsang.medium.com](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/brief-review-competition-level-code-generation-with-alphacode-6d72bf4f77f4#:~:text=,released%20under%20the%20name%20CodeContests) and GitHub data) using our 4×A100 GPUs. This fine-tuning (with supervised learning) will take on the order of a couple weeks to converge for a 6-13B model, which is feasible[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.23261v1#:~:text=8%201%202%204%208,7%2027%2014%207%204). We integrate a simple tool interface for code execution (perhaps just a Python sandbox). The agent at this stage can take a prompt like "Solve this problem…" and generate code, then run it and see if tests pass. **Success criteria:** The agent can solve basic programming tasks (e.g. from an easy leetcode set or simple script requests) by iteratively coding and testing. We also build the basic memory store, but it might not be heavily used yet (mainly to log attempts). Planning is minimal here; essentially the agent does a generate-run-fix loop. This phase establishes the core LLM’s ability and the tool execution pipeline.
2.  **Phase 2: Add Planning & Modular Tools (Weeks 4-8)** – _Goal:_ Expand the agent’s abilities beyond coding to simple **operating tasks**, and introduce explicit planning. We implement the Planning Module and more tools (file operations, maybe a shell command runner). The agent is now tested on multi-step tasks, e.g.: "Create a directory, write a hello world program in it, run it, then compress the directory." Such a task requires planning (multiple steps) and using different tools. We fine-tune the LLM further on **multi-step task data**. This data could be partially synthetic: we create scripts of step-by-step solutions (like a small script that describes how to do a task) and train the LLM to follow that format. Reinforcement learning could also begin here in a limited way: for instance, reward the agent for completing all steps of a task successfully, to encourage good planning. With 4 GPUs, we can parallelize environment simulations to generate experience for RL (each GPU could run an instance of the environment + agent to collect data). Weeks of training in this phase will improve the agent’s decision-making. **Success criteria:** The agent can reliably complete multi-step file system tasks and simple coding projects without manual intervention. It should be able to break down a request into steps and handle if one step fails (e.g., if compiling code fails, fix code and try again).
3.  **Phase 3: Scaling Up Complexity (Weeks 8-16)** – _Goal:_ Tackle more complex, real-world scenarios with the agent. In this phase, we incorporate more realistic development tasks: building a small software project (multiple files), using external libraries, or interacting with an external system (maybe a database or a web API). We also introduce **multi-agent or role specialization** if beneficial. For example, we could have the agent core instantiate a “Reviewer sub-agent” (which might just be the core model prompted to act as a code reviewer) to double-check code, mimicking ChatDev’s programmer-reviewer dynamic[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2307.07924#:~:text=user%20requirements,main%20contributions%20are%20as%20follows). This can be done by simply invoking the model twice with different system prompts, rather than actually training two separate models – so it is computationally feasible. During this phase, the training involves a mix of techniques: continued fine-tuning on more data (including logs from Phase 2 to learn from mistakes fixed), and possibly **reinforcement learning from feedback**. We can apply _RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)_: where we have humans or a heuristic reward model rank the agent’s outputs (did it produce correct and clean code? did it avoid risky operations?), and use policy gradient methods to refine the model towards preferred behaviors[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.16334#:~:text=Inductive%20Reasoning%20and%20Deductive%20Reasoning%2C,gap%20with%20human%20reasoning%20ability)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.16334#:~:text=external%20domain%20knowledge%20in%20real,still%20faces%20many%20systematic%20challenges). This is compute-intensive, but our 4 GPUs can handle a modest scale RL finetune if the model is not too large. Running RL for a few weeks could significantly improve the agent’s ability to make decisions that align with success (since it will directly optimize long-term task completion reward). **Success criteria:** The agent can handle a user request like “Set up a simple web server, and then update the system configuration file to run it on startup” – which involves writing code, modifying config, using shell commands, and verifying all is well. It should also demonstrate learning: tasks that failed initially are now handled after further training.
4.  **Phase 4: Robustness, Optimization, and Real-Time Deployment (Months 4-6)** – _Goal:_ Harden the system for long-term autonomy and improve performance. In this phase, we address edge cases and optimize. We integrate the full **memory system** for persistent knowledge – e.g., let the agent build up a knowledge base of troubleshooting tips or API usage as it works on various tasks, and verify it indeed uses that memory (we test tasks that require recalling something from a past different task). We also focus on **real-time aspects**: we set up a live environment (perhaps a VM or a dedicated machine) where the agent runs continuously, listening for incoming requests or triggers (like a cron job that the agent monitors). We profile the system for latency and optimize, possibly by distilling the large model to a faster one for certain decisions, or using techniques like caching frequent results. If the model is too slow per step, we consider a smaller model or an ensemble where a small model handles easy cases and only defer to big model for hard cases. Additionally, safety checks are finalized in this phase: we simulate misbehaving instructions to ensure the agent refuses or asks for confirmation appropriately. From a training perspective, this phase is more about fine-tuning on corner cases and perhaps applying _curriculum learning_: we present the agent with increasingly difficult scenarios to make it robust. We might also run an extensive test suite and use any failures as additional training data (a form of automated adversarial training). This phase could last a couple of months because polishing an AI system is open-ended – essentially _extended training_ to reach “leading performance.” We leverage the fact that more training time tends to yield better performance[sh-tsang.medium.com](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/brief-review-competition-level-code-generation-with-alphacode-6d72bf4f77f4#:~:text=,but%20eventually%20outperformed%20smaller%20models), so we continue training until improvements plateau. Our four GPUs might be running almost constantly during this time, refining the model. **Success criteria:** The agent achieves a high success rate on a broad benchmark of tasks (which we define). It should be reliable enough to be given continuous control in a constrained environment. For instance, it could autonomously manage a small server: updating code, restarting services, handling errors, without crashing or needing intervention over an extended period.
5.  **Phase 5: Extended Capabilities and Research (Month 6+)** – _Goal:_ (Optional/future) Push beyond the initial vision by exploring additional capabilities and conducting research on unresolved challenges. In this phase, we consider integrating a **GUI vision module** (so the agent can operate graphical applications by “seeing” the screen – this would involve a vision transformer or detection model to parse screen pixels and a mapping to UI actions, akin to how ACT-1 sees pixels[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xji7gt/act1_how_adept_is_building_the_future_of_ai_with/#:~:text=Transformers%20www,pixels%20and%20act%20on)). We also explore multi-agent collaboration at scale: multiple agent instances handling different tasks concurrently or cooperating on a project (for example, one agent codes while another simultaneously writes documentation, sharing progress via memory). Another research direction is **continual learning**: enabling the agent to update its own model weights on the fly when encountering novel situations (with mechanisms to avoid catastrophic forgetting). During this phase, the training might involve _online reinforcement learning_ in a live environment – essentially letting the agent run and only intervening to correct it when it goes off track, using those interventions as feedback to improve policy. We schedule these experiments knowing they may require months of training and tuning. With the infrastructure built in earlier phases, our 4 GPUs can now be devoted to whichever experiment yields the best improvement (be it scaling the model size, training longer, or adding new modalities). **Success criteria:** goes beyond just task success – we measure improvement in capabilities like adaptation to entirely new tasks (generalization) or the ability to learn new APIs by reading documentation autonomously (a form of autonoetic learning). This is the open-ended research-oriented phase that could continue indefinitely, but by now the agent should be operational and useful, even as we keep improving it.

Each phase concludes with a **review and consolidation** step: we merge the best changes into the main system, and ensure stability before moving on. Importantly, earlier phases yield usable sub-systems (for example, by end of Phase 2 we have a decent coding assistant, by end of Phase 3 an early autonomous DevOps agent). This phased approach ensures that even if later ambitious goals prove difficult, we still have intermediate deliverables.

Throughout development, we plan to maintain a comprehensive **test suite and benchmark** to quantitatively track progress. This includes sets of coding problems, scripted OS tasks, and eventually real user scenarios. We will measure things like success rate, time to completion, number of errors made, etc. These metrics will guide training: if we see certain weaknesses (e.g., the agent struggles with planning deeper than 5 steps), we can create curriculum focused on that, or adjust the architecture (maybe the planning module needs an upgrade).

Future Research and Improvement Areas
-------------------------------------

While the above plan lays a path to a functional autonomous coding agent, there are several areas of ongoing investigation to push the boundaries further:

*   **Scaling Model Size and Knowledge**: Our design currently balances model size with hardware, but future work could involve scaling up to truly massive models (hundreds of billions of parameters) for greater coding prowess and understanding. Techniques like model parallelism or offloading could be used with the 4 A100s to experiment with a larger core model. More knowledge could also be injected by pre-training on specialized corpora (e.g., full documentation of operating systems, APIs, etc.).
*   **Enhanced Multi-Modal Integration**: Incorporating vision (for GUI automation) and possibly speech (if the agent were to interact via voice) remains an open challenge. Research into vision-language-action models (like robotics planning models) could inform an extension where the agent sees the screen and controls mouse/keyboard in a human-like way[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=One%20of%20my%20latest%20articles,AI%20with%20robotics%20%E2%80%94%20the)[thealgorithmicbridge.com](https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/act-1-how-adept-is-building-the-future#:~:text=But%20physical%20robots%20aren%E2%80%99t%20the,to%20some%20extent%2C%20their%20behavior). This would require collecting training data of screen interactions or synthesizing it.
*   **Learning to Debug and Synthesize**: While the agent can test and fix code, advanced debugging (especially for logic errors, not just runtime errors) is hard. An area of research is integrating formal methods or symbolic analysis – e.g., the agent could use a theorem prover or static analyzer tool for critical code. Also, synthesizing code that is provably correct (using techniques from program synthesis community) could improve reliability for certain tasks.
*   **Improving Planning Algorithms**: Our current planning is relatively simple. We could investigate more sophisticated planners (for instance, employing search algorithms that the LLM guides, or training a separate planning network via reinforcement learning). Also, meta-planning – the ability of the agent to decide _when_ to invoke the planner or when to ask for help – is an interesting direction.
*   **Memory Scaling and Semantic Compression**: As the agent operates for months, the memory store will grow. We need research into better memory management: e.g., **hierarchical memory** (memory of memories), semantic compression (using the LLM itself to periodically digest and rewrite its knowledge base more concisely), and retrieval optimization. Ensuring the agent retrieves the most relevant pieces and not be distracted by irrelevant past events is non-trivial when the memory is huge.
*   **Autonomous Self-Improvement**: A long-term vision is an agent that can improve its own codebase or even its own model. For example, it could identify weaknesses in its abilities and suggest fine-tuning on certain data, essentially participating in its training loop. This borders on _AutoML_ or self-evolving systems. With caution, we might let the agent modify parts of its modules (maybe it can rewrite a faulty planning routine or adjust a prompt). This requires careful sandboxing to avoid degeneration, but if successful, it moves closer to a system that **learns like a human employee would on the job**, steadily gaining skill.
*   **Safety and Alignment Research**: Ensuring the agent’s actions remain aligned with user intent and ethical norms is an ongoing concern. Future work includes building a more explicit _value alignment module_ or using advanced RLHF to fine-tune the agent’s preferences. We might integrate a monitoring system that can intervene if the agent goes outside allowed bounds (for example, attempting to access unauthorized data or perform a disallowed operation). Research into explainability could also help – making the agent explain _why_ it wants to do an action before doing it, allowing a supervisory process (human or automated) to veto if it sounds problematic.
*   **Evaluation in Real-world Conditions**: Finally, a research area is understanding how such an agent performs in the wild: on unknown tasks, with unpredictable environments. This includes robustness to changes (software updates, new error types) and adversarial conditions (e.g., malicious inputs trying to trick the agent). We plan to continually test and improve the agent under diverse scenarios, potentially using simulation to generate rare events (like network failures, etc., to see how the agent copes).

In conclusion, the proposed architecture – with its modular components for planning, memory, tool integration, and a powerful LLM core – is a blueprint for an autonomous coding and computer-operating agent. We started by challenging the naive approach of “just use a big model” and introduced targeted improvements addressing memory, reasoning, and reliability. The detailed design and phased plan ensure that we can incrementally build, train, and refine this system using the resources available (4×A100 GPUs), achieving useful performance in weeks and aiming for cutting-edge performance with sustained training over months. By following this plan and exploring the outlined research directions, we move closer to a **general-purpose AI assistant** capable of handling the complexities of software development and computer operations in real time – a tool that could revolutionize productivity and enable entirely new workflows in the software engineering domain.

Critical Architecture Challenge & Improvements
==============================================

Where the v1 design will bend or break
--------------------------------------

*   **Credit assignment across HRM⇄LLM:** Subgoal latents  $g_t$  steer tokens, but no supervised signal pinpoints _which_ plan decisions led to downstream success.  
    **Fix:** add _plan-grounded targets_ (spec diffs, unit‑test coverage deltas) and contrastive InfoNCE on  $g_t$  vs achieved state embeddings; use hindsight relabeling to assign success to the most causally‑relevant  $g_t$ .
*   **Energy miscalibration:** A sequence‑EBM trained with naïve positives/negatives drifts and over‑penalizes benign variations.  
    **Fix:** calibrate with _temperature‑scaled logistic NCE_, stratified negatives (syntax‑valid but semantically wrong; flaky tests; policy‑violating actions). Maintain per‑domain energy heads (code, shell, editor) with shared trunk.
*   **Test‑time compute waste:** Constant  $K$  candidates and static beam over‑spend on easy steps.  
    **Fix:** _Adaptive compute scheduler_: set  $K$  by entropy of LLM logits and EBM margin; early‑exit when margin > threshold; escalate to deliberation mode (bigger context, slower decode) only when HRM signals high risk.
*   **Tool schema drift:** Free‑form tool calls cause brittle parsing.  
    **Fix:** _Constrained decoding_ with JSON schema CFG; add a small _Tool Policy Classifier_ (TPC) trained on (state, goal)→(tool, args) to gate LLM proposals.
*   **Memory interference:** Uncurated retrieval injects stale “fixes.”  
    **Fix:** dual‑score retrieval by (semantic sim)×(freshness×provenance). Summarize long‑tail memories into _capability notes_; treat raw logs as cold storage.
*   **Modularity tax on latency:** HRM/EBM as separate forward passes adds hops.  
    **Fix:** fuse _lightweight logit‑shaping_ head into LLM block (feature‑wise affine from EBM trunk); keep full EBM for segment‑level rerank.
*   **Single‑backbone bias:** One decoder underperforms across modes (shell, Python, TS/JS, config).  
    **Fix:** _Assembly‑of‑Experts (AoE)_: maintain 3–5 specialist backbones (Py/NumPy, JS/DOM, Bash/DevOps, Editor/Refactor). HRM gates selection; occasional tensor‑space interpolation to spawn new hybrids; distill back to a generalist.

### 1) HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Module)

*   Two‑timescale: planner GRU updates  $g_t$  every  $K$  steps; worker transformer consumes  $[h_t; g_t]$  to emit  $c_t$  (tool priors, risk score, expert priors).
*   **Losses:**
    *   _Plan InfoNCE:_ pull  $g_t$  toward embeddings of achieved subgoals; push vs counterfactual next‑states.
    *   _Risk BCE:_ predict failure within  $H$  steps → conditions compute scheduler.
    *   _Tool prior CE:_ supervise (state→tool) from traces.

### 2) LLM AoE (Assembly‑of‑Experts)

*   Pool of small/medium code‑specialist decoders (e.g., 7–13B each).
*   **Routing:** HRM emits expert priors  $p(e|c_t)$ ; soft routing for draft, hard pick for final; optional _tensor interpolation_ to spawn niche children; periodic _distillation_ into a single generalist for deploy.

### 3) EBM (Energy Model)

*   Bi‑encoder trunk (code & action modalities) + heads:
    *   **Code energy:** compiles? tests? static checks?
    *   **Shell energy:** precondition/form‑policy penalties.
    *   **Editor energy:** AST diff quality, spec similarity.
*   **Training:** stratified NCE with: (i) passed runs, (ii) failed but plausible, (iii) policy‑violating. Temperature‑scaled.
*   **Use:** (a) in‑block logit shaping (cheap), (b) segment rerank (expensive).

### 4) Tool & Policy Layer

*   JSON‑schema constrained calls; TPC (RoBERTa‑size) validates/auto‑fills args; unsafe actions require HRM risk < τ and EBM energy < τ₂.

### 5) Memory/RAG

*   Two stores: _hot_ (task‑local, window‑bounded) and _cold_ (vector DB with provenance).
*   Retrieval filter: score = sim × freshness × success‑rate × domain‑match.

### 6) Adaptive Compute Scheduler

*   Inputs: entropy(H), EBM margin(ΔE), HRM risk(r).
*   Policy: if H<τ and ΔE>m → K=1 fast path; else K↑ and switch to deliberation template; escalate expert depth before beam width.

* * *

Training Objectives
===================

$$
\mathcal{L}=\lambda_{LM}\mathcal{L}_{CE} +\lambda_{plan}\mathcal{L}_{InfoNCE} +\lambda_{tool}\mathcal{L}_{CE} +\lambda_{risk}\mathcal{L}_{BCE} +\lambda_{EBM}\mathcal{L}_{NCE} +\lambda_{RL}\mathcal{J}_{PG}
$$
*   ** $\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ :** supervised next‑token & tool JSON generation.
*   **InfoNCE:** positives = achieved‑state embeddings within horizon; negatives = untaken branches.
*   **EBM‑NCE:** logistic with stratified negatives; temperature tuned per head.
*   **Policy gradient:** end‑to‑end reward = tests pass − latency − violations; advantage baselined by EBM energy.

* * *

Data & Trace Generation
=======================

*   **Seeds:** curated repos w/ tests; scripts for OS tasks (fs ops, packaging, services).
*   **Self‑play:** goal→plan→act; collect (state, tool, args, result), unit test outcomes.
*   **Negatives:** mutate AST (off‑by‑one, wrong API), reorder plans, drop preconditions, inject flaky tests.
*   **Labels:** tool gold from scripted demos; plan gold from shortest successful traces.

* * *

4×A100 System Plan
==================

### Short (Weeks 1–4)

*   Start with 1 generalist 7–13B + 1–2 specialists; LoRA/QLoRA finetune on code+tool JSON; fit on single GPU per model.
*   Train EBM trunk (~0.3–0.7B) on pass/fail traces; integrate logit shaper.
*   Bring up constrained decoding & TPC.
*   **Deliverables:** pass small SWE‑style tasks; safe fs/shell ops.

### Medium (Weeks 5–8)

*   Add HRM losses; enable adaptive K; build stratified negative sampler.
*   Introduce AoE routing; distill specialists → stronger generalist checkpoint.
*   **Deliverables:** multi‑file projects; stable tool policy adherence; latency p95 < target.

### Long (Months 3+)

*   Reinforcement fine‑tune with test rewards; expand specialist pool; occasional AoE interpolation to spawn niche experts; periodic global distill.
*   Harden memory (fresh/provenance gating); broaden OS task library.
*   **Deliverables:** leading pass@1 on internal suite; robust OS automation with rollback.

* * *

Evaluation Matrix
=================

*   **Coding:** pass@k, fix@k, test coverage delta, static‑check violations.
*   **OS ops:** task success, precondition violations, destructive‑action rate, rollback success.
*   **Efficiency:** steps to success, p95 latency, token‑per‑success, tool‑call retries.
*   **Reliability:** EBM–LLM disagreement rate, risk‑gated veto accuracy, memory helpfulness A/B.
*   **Ablations:** {no‑HRM, no‑EBM, no‑AoE}, {fixed‑K vs adaptive}, {free‑form vs JSON‑CFG}.

* * *

Interfaces (must‑fix)
=====================

### Tool Call (constrained)

```json
{
  "tool": "exec_code|shell|fs|editor",
  "args": { "lang": "python", "code": "..." },
  "policy": { "allow_network": false, "timeout_s": 15 }
}
```

### Observation

```json
{ "ok": true, "stdout": "...", "stderr": "", "artifacts": ["path"], "duration_ms": 317 }
```

### HRM Control Vector (to LLM)

```
[c_tool_prior; c_expert_prior; c_risk; c_deliberation_flag]
```

* * *

Safety & Rollback
=================

*   Immutable workspace per task, write‑audit, auto‑snapshot before high‑risk ops.
*   Dual veto: TPC policy + EBM energy; human‑in‑the‑loop toggle for destructive ops.
*   Mandatory rollback script generation after any state‑changing sequence.

* * *

Why modular (and when not)
==========================

*   **Modular** buys debuggability, parallel iteration, and tailored scaling per subproblem (HRM small; EBM mid; LLM largest).
*   **Integrate** only the cheap path: in‑block logit shaper and expert priors as lightweight heads to cut hops without losing separability.

* * *

Immediate Worklist (sprint‑sized)
=================================

1.  Implement JSON‑CFG constrained decoding + TPC.
2.  EBM trunk + code/shell/editor heads; integrate shaper; add segment rerank.
3.  HRM with InfoNCE and risk head; wire adaptive‑K scheduler.
4.  Assemble 200–500 scripted OS/coding tasks with tests; build negative sampler.
5.  Baseline, then ablate to quantify HRM/EBM/AoE gains; lock thresholds for production.

This gives you a concrete, defensible roadmap from today’s prototype to a fast, safe, and high‑win‑rate autonomous coder/operator on 4×A100.

Runtime topology & scheduling (4×A100 40GB)
===========================================

**Process layout**

*   **P0 (LLM‑AoE)**: generalist decoder (7–13B) + 1–2 specialists resident (tensor‑parallel 2‑way if >20B equiv). KV cache pinned; FlashAttention‑2.
*   **P1 (EBM)**: 0.3–0.7B bi‑encoder + heads; exposes gRPC `score(seq, feats)`; low‑latency path for logit shaping.
*   **P2 (HRM+Scheduler)**: planner GRU/worker encoder, risk head, adaptive‑K policy; owns JSON‑CFG constrained decoding.
*   **P3 (Tools+Memory)**: sandbox (nsjail/docker), FS API, shell, exec, editor; vector DB (ANN) + embedder.

**GPU binding**

*   A100‑0: LLM core; A100‑1: specialists / draft model (speculative decode); A100‑2: EBM trunk; A100‑3: HRM/worker, embedder, TPC.
*   NVLink peer‑to‑peer for KV/act logits; gRPC within box (Unix domain sockets).

**Throughput guardrails**

*   Max ctx 8k (v1), target token latency <60ms (fast path). Batch ≤4; streaming partials every 30–60 tokens.
*   Draft→target speculative decoding when entropy<τe; accept‑rate tracked; fall back on miss streaks.

* * *

Inference optimizations
=======================

*   **Constrained decoding**: JSON grammar via DFA; invalid arcs masked pre‑softmax; eliminates parse‑repair loops.
*   **Logit shaping**: in‑block affine head fed by EBM trunk features  $\tilde{\ell}=\ell - \alpha W f_{EBM}(x)$ . Cheap, always‑on.
*   **Segment rerank**: every N tokens or on tool boundary, generate K candidates, call EBM `score`; early‑exit if margin>m.
*   **Speculative decode**: 1–2B draft expert proposes; target verifies; HRM toggles based on risk r\_t.
*   **Paged KV**: window‑edits without re‑encode; plan tokens pinned; tool JSON sections marked non‑attend for specialists.
*   **Quantization**: W8A8 weight‑only for specialists (AWQ); keep generalist bf16; SmoothQuant for EBM if pressured.

* * *

Data/trace engine
=================

**Unified JSONL schema**

```json
{
  "task_id": "...",
  "goal": "natural language",
  "steps": [{"action":"plan|tool|gen|review", "content":"...", "obs": "...", "ok": true}],
  "code_artifacts": [{"path":"...", "lang":"py", "ast":"sha256"}],
  "tests": {"passed":12, "failed":1, "logs":"..."},
  "env": {"fs_snapshot":"cid", "policy":"profile_v3"},
  "result": "success|fail|partial"
}
```

*   **Provenance**: hash artifacts, tool outputs; store seeds for replay.
*   **Negative sampler**: AST mutations (off‑by‑one, wrong API), plan perturb (drop precondition), shell hazards (sudo, rm ‑rf) gated in sandbox.
*   **Synth tasks**: scripted OS ops (fs, archiving, services), mini‑projects with unit tests; inject flakiness rate p to harden recovery.

* * *

HRM details
===========

**Core**

*   Planner GRU:  $d_{plan}=512$ , update every  $K=8$  steps.
*   Worker encoder: 4× transformer blocks over  $[h_t; g_t]$  → control  $c_t\in\mathbb{R}^{256}$ .

**Losses**

*   **Plan‑InfoNCE**: positives = embeddings of achieved deltas  $\phi(s_{t+H})-\phi(s_t)$ ; negatives = sibling branches.
*   **Risk‑BCE**: predict failure within  $H=16$  tokens or next tool boundary.
*   **Tool‑prior CE**: supervise (state→tool,arg‑slots) from gold traces.

**Compute scheduler**

```python
if (entropy<τH and ΔE>m): K=1; fast_path=True
elif r_t>τR: deliberate=True; K=min(K_max, 2K)
else: K=K_base
```

*   **Deliberation** switches template to richer CoT, expands retrieval budget, disables speculative decode.

* * *

AoE (assembly‑of‑experts)
=========================

**Pool**

*   G‑gen (generalist), E‑py (Py/NumPy), E‑js (JS/DOM), E‑sh (shell/DevOps), E‑edit (refactor/AST‑aware). 7–13B each.

**Routing**

*   HRM emits priors  $p(e|c_t)$ ; soft mixture for draft; hard pick for final segment.

**Interpolation**

*   For compatible pairs (same arch/tokenizer), spawn child:  $W_c=\alpha W_a+(1-\alpha)W_b$  layerwise; quick SFT on niche set; promote if beats parent on slice.

**Distill**

*   KL from AoE mixture to G‑gen on diverse tasks + RL test‑pass reward; freeze safety heads to avoid drift.

* * *

EBM training
============

**Trunk**

*   12‑layer encoder (d=768) over tokenized sequence of mixed modalities (code, tool JSON, stderr). Cross‑attend light features.

**Energy**

$$
E(x)=E_{model}(x)+\lambda^\top f(x)
$$
*   **Features  $f(x)$ **:
    *   Code: compile\_errs, test\_fail\_ct, cyclomatic ↑, lints, diff size, API mismatch flags.
    *   Shell: precondition miss, forbidden cmd, cwd/perm mismatch, non‑idempotency.
    *   Editor: AST breakage, spec cosine gap, doc‑test delta.

**NCE**

*   Positives: passed traces (stable ≥2 replays).
*   Negatives: (i) plausible‑fail, (ii) policy‑violate, (iii) flaky.
*   Logistic with temperature  $T$ ; per‑domain heads; EMA teacher for stability.

**Calibration**

*   Map energy→success prob via isotonic on validation; threshold search for veto rules.

* * *

Tool & policy layer
===================

*   **TPC** (Tool Policy Classifier): RoBERTa‑base; input = (goal,state,proposal JSON); outputs allow/auto‑fill/deny.
*   **CFG** per tool; args validated/coerced; secrets redaction; network off by default; timeouts; disk quota.
*   **Rollback**: snapshot FS before high‑risk; auto‑generate revert script; commit log with diffs.

* * *

Memory/RAG
==========

*   **Hot store**: task‑local ring buffer, windowed summaries per step.
*   **Cold store**: ANN (HNSW) with fields {sim, freshness, success\_rate, domain}.
*   **Retriever score**  $=sim\times\text{fresh}\times\text{success}\times\text{domain\_match}$ .
*   **Summarizers**: periodic “capability notes” replacing long tails; raw logs archived.

* * *

Bench & evaluation
==================

**Coding**

*   Internal suite: HumanEval+, MBPP‑ext, repo‑mini (multi‑file), SWE‑style patches under harness.
*   Metrics: pass@1/3, fix@k, test coverage Δ, static‑violation ct, runtime.

**OS/ops**

*   Script packs: fs, packaging, services, cron, container basics.
*   Metrics: success rate, precondition violations, destructive‑action veto accuracy, rollback success.

**Agentics**

*   Steps‑to‑success, token‑per‑success, p95 latency, tool‑retry rate, EBM‑LLM disagreement.

**Ablations**

*   −HRM, −EBM, −AoE; fixed‑K vs adaptive; free‑form vs JSON‑CFG; no‑spec‑decode.

* * *

Security & governance
=====================

*   **Sandbox** per task; capability profile; allow‑lists; no network by default; explicit consent gates.
*   **Dual veto**: TPC+EBM; human‑approval mode for destructive ops.
*   **Secrets**: `.env` vault, redaction filters; hashed logs; PII scrubber in trace pipeline.

* * *

Training plan (detail)
======================

**Weeks 1–2 (SFT‑1)**

*   LoRA SFT on code+tool‑JSON (50–100B tokens mixed); bf16; DeepSpeed ZeRO‑3; GA to hit global batch ≥2M tokens.
*   Train TPC on labeled tool proposals (auto‑filled from scripts).

**Weeks 3–4 (EBM‑1)**

*   Generate ~200k traces (success/fail). Train EBM+feature heads; integrate logit shaper; calibrate thresholds.

**Weeks 5–6 (HRM‑1)**

*   Add InfoNCE/risk; mine counterfactuals by branch rollouts; bring adaptive‑K online; enable speculative decode.

**Weeks 7–8 (AoE‑1)**

*   Spin up 2–3 specialists; route with HRM priors; distill mixture→generalist.

**Months 3–4 (RL‑1)**

*   GRPO/ppo: reward = tests\_pass − latency − violations + EBM\_margin; clip ε=0.2; KL‑penalty to SFT.
*   Curriculum: single‑file→multi‑file→service tasks; introduce flakiness.

**Months 5–6 (Hardening)**

*   Expand toolset; broaden OS tasks; memory summarization; red‑team safety; long‑horizon projects with periodic checkpoints.

* * *

CI/CD & observability
=====================

*   **Unit tests**: tool schemas, parser, veto logic, rollback.
*   **Sim tests**: 500 scripted tasks nightly; flake budget <2%.
*   **Dashboards**: success, latency p95, veto hits, EBM calibration, routing shares, speculative accept‑rate.
*   **Canary**: new checkpoints shadow‑run; promote on green metrics over 3k tasks.

* * *

Risk register (top)
===================

*   **Energy over‑veto** → degrade success: mitigate with calibrated isotonic maps + human overrides.
*   **Memory contamination** → stale fixes: enforce freshness/provenance weighting, TTLs.
*   **Tool schema drift**: strict CFG; schema versioning; contract tests.
*   **Latency creep**: profiler budget; adaptive‑K; speculative decode; AWQ specialists.

* * *

Minimal APIs
============

**Tool proposal**

```json
{"tool":"shell","args":{"cmd":"pytest -q"}, "policy":{"timeout_s":8}}
```

**Observation**

```json
{"ok":true,"stdout":".. 24 passed","stderr":"","duration_ms":713}
```

**HRM control (to LLM)**

```
[tool_prior: onehot(4); expert_prior: softmax(5); risk: float; deliberate: bit]
```

* * *

Acceptance gates
================

*   **Alpha**: ≥85% on internal OS pack, ≥70% pass@1 small code suite, p95 <1.5s/segment, zero destructive actions.
*   **Beta**: ≥92% OS, ≥80% pass@1, rollback success ≥99%, EBM calibration AUC ≥0.9.
*   **Prod**: sustained ≥95% OS, ≥85% pass@1, p95 <900ms, human overrides <0.5%.

* * *

Next concrete steps (2 weeks)
=============================

1.  Ship JSON‑CFG decoder + TPC gating with unit tests.
2.  Train EBM‑1 on 200k synthetic traces; wire logit shaping + segment rerank.
3.  Implement HRM‑1 (InfoNCE/risk) and adaptive‑K.
4.  Build 300‑task OS/coding suite with gold traces + negatives.
5.  Run ablations; lock thresholds; freeze Alpha checkpoint.

This completes the deep spec and turns it into an executable plan with clear thresholds, APIs, and GPU‑aware topology.

Great—let’s finish the build spec with implementation‑level details you can adopt directly. I also shipped an expanded repo with policy gating, JSON‑CFG validation, EBM feature hooks, scheduler, and a unified eval runner: **Download v2 ZIP**.

Agent loop (pseudocode, production shape)
-----------------------------------------

```python
while True:
  S = observe_state()                          # goal, logs, memory hits
  g_t, c_t, risk = HRM.step(S)                 # plan latent, control, risk
  priors = {experts: c_t.expert_prior, tools: c_t.tool_prior}
  K, deliberate = scheduler(entropy(last_logits), ebm_margin, risk)
  out = LLM.generate(S, priors, K=K, deliberate=deliberate, json_cfg=True)
  if is_tool_call(out):
      proposal = parse_json(out); verdict = TPC.check(proposal)
      if not verdict.allow: emit("denied", verdict.reason); continue
      obs = tools.exec(proposal); log(obs); update_memory(obs)
      ebm_margin = EBM.margin(history+obs); continue
  else:
      commit_output(out); maybe_terminate()
```

JSON‑CFG tool calls (hard constraints)
--------------------------------------

*   Enforced by DFA at decode + post‑parse validation (see `decoding/json_cfg.py`).
*   Deny‑list for shell hazards; default `timeout_s` auto‑filled.
*   TPC veto path: `tools/tpc.py` (heuristic now; drop‑in ML later).

**Example (valid)**

```json
{"tool":"exec_code","args":{"lang":"python","code":"print('ok')","timeout_s":10},"policy":{"allow_network":false}}
```

EBM integration (cheap + strong)
--------------------------------

*   **Always‑on logit shaping**: in‑block affine from EBM trunk features; negligible latency.
*   **Segment rerank**: on tool boundaries / every N tokens, K candidates scored; early‑exit on margin.
*   **Features**: compile/runtime errors, stderr tokens, diff size, cyclomatic proxy, policy flags (see `models/ebm_features.py`).

Adaptive compute policy (latency guardrails)
--------------------------------------------

*   Inputs: softmax entropy, EBM margin, HRM risk.
*   Fast path: `entropy<τH ∧ margin>m ⇒ K=1, no deliberation`.
*   Escalate on risk spikes: double K, switch to richer prompt, disable speculative decode.
*   Implemented in `runtime/scheduler.py`.

Data & negatives (pragmatic)
----------------------------

*   **Gold traces**: 300–500 scripted OS + coding tasks with tests and expected artifacts.
*   **Negatives**: AST mutations, precondition drops, policy violations, flaky tests; replay each to tag “plausible‑fail” vs “policy‑fail”.
*   Store all in unified JSONL (task, steps, obs, artifacts, env snapshot).

Metrics you’ll watch (dashboards)
---------------------------------

*   Success@1, steps‑to‑success, token‑per‑success, p95 latency/segment.
*   Veto accuracy (TPC/EBM), rollback success, destructive‑action rate.
*   EBM calibration (AUC, isotonic fit), routing share per expert, spec‑decode accept rate.

CI gates (ship/no‑ship)
-----------------------

*   Alpha: ≥85% OS pack, ≥70% pass@1 small code suite, p95 <1.5s/segment, zero destructive actions.
*   Beta: ≥92% / ≥80% / p95 <1.0s, rollback ≥99%, EBM AUC ≥0.9.
*   Prod: ≥95% / ≥85% / p95 <0.9s, human overrides <0.5%.

Next 10 days (doable on 4×A100)
-------------------------------

1.  Lock JSON‑CFG decoder + TPC gating (unit tests).
2.  Train EBM‑v1 on ~200k mixed traces; calibrate thresholds; wire shaping + rerank.
3.  Add HRM InfoNCE + risk head; enable adaptive‑K.
4.  Build 300‑task eval pack + negative sampler; wire `eval/eval_suite.py`.
5.  Run ablations; freeze Alpha checkpoint and thresholds.

If you want, I can wire this into your existing SWE‑bench/OS task harness and return a turnkey training script + dockerized runtime next.

Want me to wire real SWE‑bench harness hooks next?

## Prompt:
yes, please continue

## Response:
Request for GPT-5 Pro

Reasoned for 3m 17s

Shipped. **Download v4 ZIP** — real **SWE‑bench harness hooks** wired, no regressions.

What you get
------------

*   `eval/swebench_generate_predictions.py` → writes **predictions.jsonl** in the official schema (instance\_id/model/prediction). [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/SWE-bench/guides/evaluation/)
*   `eval/swebench_run_eval.py` → programmatic `run_evaluation(...)` with CLI fallback. [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/SWE-bench/faq/)
*   Keeps all v1–v3 modules intact (LLM/HRM/EBM, JSON‑CFG, TPC, scheduler, eval suite).

Quick run
---------

Generate stub predictions (replace stub later with your patch synth):

```bash
python -m hybrid_agent.eval.swebench_generate_predictions \
  --dataset_name princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite --out preds.jsonl --limit 5 --model_name hrm-llm-ebm-v4
```

Evaluate via official harness:

```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation \
  --dataset_name princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite \
  --predictions_path preds.jsonl --max_workers 8 --run_id my_eval
```

(or) our wrapper:

```bash
python -m hybrid_agent.eval.swebench_run_eval \
  --dataset_name princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite --predictions_path preds.jsonl --max_workers 8
```

Prediction format and CLI are per the **Evaluation Guide**; datasets: `princeton-nlp/SWE-bench`, `_Lite`, `_Verified`. Docker is required by the harness. [SWE-bench+1](https://www.swebench.com/SWE-bench/guides/evaluation/)

Want me to drop in a real patch synthesizer (unified‑diff builder + repo checkout + test‑driven loop) next?

## Prompt:
continue

## Response:
Request for GPT-5 Pro

Reasoned for 4m 49s

Shipped. **Download v5 ZIP** — adds a working **patch synthesizer loop** for SWE‑bench‑style workflows, while preserving all prior v1–v4 modules and interfaces.

### What’s new (kept all previous logic intact)

*   `swe/local_patch_agent.py` — iterative **test→analyze→patch** loop over a checked‑out repo (uses git branch, runs tests, applies heuristic fixes, stages changes, emits unified diff).
*   `swe/patch_utils.py` — git helpers, unified‑diff utilities, safe command runner.
*   `eval/swebench_generate_predictions.py` — now supports `--agent local --repo_root --test_cmd --budget` to build patches locally (e.g., inside the harness container) before writing `preds.jsonl`.
*   All earlier files (LLM/HRM/EBM, JSON‑CFG, TPC, scheduler, SWE‑bench wrappers) are unchanged unless extended; original APIs remain.

### Quick use

Local patch loop (inside a harness workspace/container with a ready repo):

```bash
python -m hybrid_agent.swe.local_patch_agent \
  --repo_root "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --test_cmd "pytest -q" \
  --budget 3 \
  --out patch.diff
```

Generate predictions JSONL using the local agent:

```bash
python -m hybrid_agent.eval.swebench_generate_predictions \
  --dataset_name princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite \
  --out preds.jsonl \
  --limit 5 \
  --model_name hrm-llm-ebm-v5 \
  --agent local \
  --repo_root "$REPO_ROOT" \
  --test_cmd "pytest -q" \
  --budget 3
```

Evaluate with official harness (unchanged from v4):

```bash
python -m swebench.harness.run_evaluation \
  --dataset_name princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite \
  --predictions_path preds.jsonl \
  --max_workers 8 --run_id my_eval
```

### Notes

*   The local patcher currently applies **heuristic fixes** (missing import, crude off‑by‑one). It’s intentionally simple and safe. Hooks are in place to call your LLM/HRM/EBM for smarter edits.
*   Patch emission is a unified diff suitable for SWE‑bench evaluation.
*   No regressions: v4 harness wrappers and earlier demos still run as before.

Want me to wire the local patch loop to the hybrid LLM+HRM+EBM (actual code‑edit proposals with EBM‑guided selection), and add AST‑aware edits + syntax validation before staging?
